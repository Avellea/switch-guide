# Installing Android

This page will detail the setup of Switchroot Android (Android 14) for the Nintendo Switch.

::: warning

**Have you partitioned your microSD card?**

This page assumes that you've followed our guide to set up Atmosphère. Before starting, your microSD card needs partitions for Android set up via hekate.

If you didn't do so, see [this page](../user_guide/all/partitioning_sd_syscfw) to install Android alongside Atmosphère. If you don't want to use Switch CFW and only Android, check the [Official Switchroot Documentation](https://wiki.switchroot.org/wiki/android/11-r-setup-guide) instead.

If you already have Android fully installed, do not follow this guide, as your current installation would be erased.

::: info

**Android 15**

Recently, Android 15 was released for the Switch. You can follow the official [LineageOS guide](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/nx_tab/) to install Android 15.

## Post-Install

### Tips and Tricks

- If Joy-Con autopairing has not kicked in, try a reboot. Sometimes the first boot doesn't pick up the addition.
- To access recovery: hold `VOL+` on boot or reboot.
- To access hekate from Android: hold `VOL-` on reboot.
- To reboot back to Android: hold `Power` for a few seconds and perform a standard reboot.
- To return to Horizon (`OFW/CFW`): power your Switch off fully, then boot into your desired mode.
